# AssignmentoUno
AssignmentoUno is a backend for a simple RPG game written in C#. The game has four different Hero classes: mage, ranger, rogue and warrior. A hero is able to equip weapons and armor, in addition to calculating total attributes and damage. Leveling up increases a Hero's attributes.

# Usage
The project has implemented xUnit tests which can be run locally, to see if the functionality works as expected
